I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly
Agreed politely I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, You hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter,
dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, You hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter,
dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar Roar-or, roar-or, roar-or I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter,
dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and
You're gonna hear me ROAR
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roarDo you ever feel like a plastic bag?
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin?
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July 'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "ah, ah, ah"
As you shoot across the sky Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "ah, ah, ah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe You don't have to feel like a wasted space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July 'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "ah, ah, ah"
As you shoot across the sky Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "ah, ah, ah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough 'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "ah, ah, ah"
As you shoot across the sky Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "ah, ah, ah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moonYou change your mind like a girl changes clothes

You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down You're wrong when it's right

You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy, now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing, now you're plain boring
I should know that you're not gonna change 'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down You're wrong when it's right

You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down Someone call the doctor, got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster, can't get off this ride You change your mind like a girl changes clothes 'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down You're wrong when it's right

There's no going backSummer after high school when we first met
We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th Birthday
We got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor And climb to the roof
Talk about our future
Like we had a clue
Never planned that one day
I'd be losing you In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other We made a pact Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on (whoa) Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the Blues
It's time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one, the one, the one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine (No)
Can't replace you with a million rings (No)
I should told you what you meant to me (Whoa)
Cause now i pay the price
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one, the one, the one
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got awayThey know what is what

Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around

You should retire
You're 'bout cute as

What the...Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed You said move on
Where do I go
I guess second best
Is all I will know Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes You're like an Indian summer
In the middle of winter
Like a hard candy
With a surprise center
How do I get better
Once I've had the best
You said there's
Tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test He kissed my lips
I taste your mouth
He pulled me in
I was disgusted with myself Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes You're the best
And yes I do regret
How I could let myself
Let you go
Now the lesson's learned
I touched it I was burned
Oh I think you should know Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh won't you walk through
And bust in the door
And take me away
Oh no more mistakes
Cause in your eyes I'd like to stayDays like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your bombs and your blows But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

Always say we're gonna sto-op, whoa But this Friday night do it all again
But this Friday night do it all again Trying to connect the dots

So consumed with the wrong things
But in the dark, I realized this life is short
And deep down, I'm still a child
Playful eyes, wide and wild
I can't lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of gold And I know that I'm still fucked up
But aren't we all, my love?
Darling, our scars make us who we are, are
So when the winds are howling strong
And you think you can't go on, hold tight, sweetheart You'll find a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you

And knocks over walls
His emerald eyes, they sparkle and shine
As he eats the food court and steals half my fries
That's what you get when you take Godzilla to the mall What do you get when you take Godzilla to meet your mom?
He rings the bell and she looks out the window, and calls the cops
I try to explain that he's mostly tame
As long as there's pizza and video games
That's what you get when you take Godzilla to meet your mom While everyone else is running and screaming
I just love being with you
I guess they don't see all the things that I'm seeing
That make you so uniquely you, you, you, you What do you get when you meet Godzilla and fall in love?Been a prisoner o-o-of the past
Had a bitterness when I looked back
Was telling everyone it's not that bad
'Til all my shit hi-hit the fan I know I'm always like
Telling everybody you don't gotta be a victim
Life ain't always fair, but Hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn, and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go Had a boogieman under my bed
Putting crazy thoughts inside my head
Always whispering, "It's all your fault"
He was telling me, "No, you're not that strong" I know I'm always like
Telling everybody you don't have to be a victim
Life ain't always fair, but Hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you So I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn, and never forget it

I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you I am afraid I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of youYou know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in colour
And do the things I want You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on over you You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me, but you see What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Footsteps even lighter

Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone When I'm aloneAnd all I remember is your back
Walking towards the airport
Leaving us all in your past
I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
Begged you to want me
But you didn't want to But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandoned things
And piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old And no, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
He loves me Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself
And now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn't free
It has to be earned
Back then I didn't have anything you needed
So I was worthless But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandoned things
And piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old And no, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
'Cause he loves me Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay Piece by piece...
Piece by piece...
Piece by piece...
Piece by piece...
Piece by piece...
Piece by piece... Piece by piece
I fell far from the tree
I would never leave her like you left me
She will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you I'm gonna put her first
And no, he'll never walk away
He'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things
He'll love her
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great
Piece by piece...
Piece by piece...
Piece by piece.Here's the thing
We started out friends
It was cool but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah, since you've been gone You're dedicated
You took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine

I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, oh, yeah, yeah, thanks to you

Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone When I'm aloneWhen you're lost in the moment
You can't see where you going
I didn't who I could trust
So I put all my faith in us
Oh, you tore me to pieces
Turned my strength into weakness
I didn't want it all to fall apart
So I decided just to play the part But honestly, I do it all again
Putting up with all the bullshit, he made me strong enough to do this You used to bother me
Thought I could never leave
After all that I've been through, nothing left to prove
No, no, no, I don't think about you
Weighing down on me
I lost my sanity
And now that we are through
Nothing left to lose
No, no, no, I don't think about you I feel freedom where I stand now
And I feel proud of who I am now
Yeah, I learned a lot along the way
I love the woman that I became I was patient, but not anymore
It's back in my hands
And you swore I'd never do it
But it's your time to face the music You used to bother me
Thought I could never leave
After all that I've been through, nothing left to prove
No, no, no, I don't think about you
Weighing down on me
I lost my sanity
And now that we are through
Nothing left to lose
No, no, no, I don't think about you It was hard to hold on
Days and nights I thought I'd never make at all
Couldn't make it at all
Now I stand tall
Feeling like myself again, no worries at all
Breathe
No one can stop me from living this moment for me I found my heartbeat
After all that I've been through
No, I don't think about you You used to bother me (you used to bother me)
Thought I could never leave (thought I could never leave)
After all that I've been through (through), nothing left to prove

Da ra ra ra ra ra
Da ra ra ra ra ra ra Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray Trying hard to reach out
But when I'd try to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I pray
I could breakaway I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away
And breakaway I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Breakaway
BreakawayRemember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye Even with our fists held high
It never would have work out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die I didn't want us to burn out, I
Didn't come here to hurt you now I can't stop I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
Started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive You know that I love you, so I
Love you enough to let you go I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone
And I'm already gone
I'm already gone You can't make it feel right
When you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone
Already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already gone Already gone
Already gone

Already gone, yeah Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye I want you to know

Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on

Already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already goneMiss Independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance, mmmm
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'll never, ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said ooh, she fell in love What is this feeling taking over? no!
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent's no longer need to be defensive?
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true
Misguided heart
Miss play it smart Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing a misconception
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love
What is this feeling taking over? no!
Thinking no one could open the door Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent's no longer need to be defensive?
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true (when love, is true)
When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid? It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of why can't that be me
I'm so glad I've finally seen
What is this feeling taking over? no!
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent's no longer need to be defensive?
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true (when love, is true)
Miss IndependentOh say, can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars
Through the perilous fight
Or the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming And the rockets' red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there Oh say does that
Star spangled banner yet wave
O the land of the free
And the home of the brave.If anyone asks
I'll tell them we both just moved on
When people all stare
I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk
Whenever I see you
I'll swallow my pride
and bite my tongue
Pretend I'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?
Cry If anyone asks
I'll tell them we just grew apart
Yeah what do I care
If they believe me or not
Whenever I feel
Your memory is breaking my heart
I'll pretend I'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?
Cry I'm talking in circles
I'm lying, they know it
Why won't this just all go away Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?
Cry
CryGuess this means you're sorry, you're standing at my door
Guess this means you take back all you said before
Like how much you wanted anyone but me
Said you'd never come back but here you are again 'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life would suck without you Maybe I was stupid for telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for trying to pick a fight
I know that I've got issues but you're pretty messed up too
Either way I've found out I'm nothing without you 'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life would suck without you Being with you is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you but I can't let you go, oh yeah 'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life would suck without you
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life would suck without youWhat if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me?
Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling
We've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment Like this Everything changes but beauty remains
Something so tender
I can't explain
Well I may be dreaming
But till I awake Can't we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment

Thanks to you
You should know (you should know)
That I get
I get what I want
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
Since you been goneWe were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes &amp; the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say "Hello", little did I know... That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you "Please don't go", &amp; I said... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince &amp; I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say "Yes" So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you "Please don't go", &amp; I said... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince &amp; I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say "Yes" Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby, just say "Yes"
...
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said... Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground &amp; pulled out a ring &amp; said Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you &amp; that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby, just say "Yes" Oh oh oh 'Cause we were both young when I first saw youYou're on the phone with your girlfriendâshe's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do. I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do But she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirt
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time. If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me? Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
"Hey, isn't this easy?" And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in awhile
Since she brought you down. You say you're fineâI know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that? She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me? Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me Can't you se that I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me? Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with meI stay out too late

(You got to) I-I-I shake it off, I shake it off
I-I-I shake it off, I shake it offLong were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor wont fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine
You paint a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight Well I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need to give love then take it away And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark twisted games?
When I loved you so
I should've known
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry
Have dried lifeless eyes Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town
Dear John I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known.
You should've known.
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known.Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me I guess you didn't care &amp; I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me 'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground Oh...
Trouble... Oh...
Trouble... No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
Now I see He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground Oh...
Trouble... Oh...
Trouble... When your saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh...
Trouble...
Oh...
Trouble...
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
TroubleYou were in college working part time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts I say, can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parent's mistakes But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine And I remember that fight, 2: 30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
I can see it nowNice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face!"
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play? New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game 'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh, my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game 'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game 'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your nameLoving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
To your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red Yeah, yeah, red
Oh, burning red And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end streetI am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream Where I stand and say
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said speak now
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride to be
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me You wish it was me
Don't you?
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow You need to hear me out
And they said speak now
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow Your time is running out
And they said speak now
I hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace
There's the silence, there's my last chance I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
So don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said speak now
And you'll say let's run away now
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said speak now'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood (hey!) Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shining now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where
I'm weak, baby, I couldn't breathe
I rubbed it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood (hey!) Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you come in my way, just don't Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood (hey!) Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts, ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey!)
You say sorry just for show (hey!)
You live like that, you live with ghosts (hey!)
Hm, if you love like that blood runs (Bad) 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (bad) (Blood) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood ('Cause now we got bad blood) 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done (look at what you've done)
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (woah)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood (hey!)There I was again tonight, forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old, tired lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?" across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts, counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder-struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you The lingering question kept me up, 2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder-struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder-struck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that
This was the very first page, not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go I'm wonder-struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder-struck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on youYou take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
"You know I haven't seen you around before." 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin round but
In your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found that time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer, even now Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all 'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me And I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to 'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all to well
Yeah And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well
Yeah 'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, 'cause you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink [Verse 1]
Dive bar on the east side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you [Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink [Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate? [Verse 2]
Third floor on the west side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you [Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink [Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate? [Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you [Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?[Chorus: Taylor Swift &amp; Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (woah, woah, woah)
I wanna be your end game, end game [Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift &amp; Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Ah, and you heard about me
Oh, I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
Ah, and I heard about you (yah)
Ooh, you like the bad ones, too [Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose
I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me (yah)
I'm a call away whenever you need me (yeah)
I'm in a G5 (yeah), come to the A-Side (yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (what they like)
You love it, I love it, too, 'cause you my type (you my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life [Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift &amp; Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play [Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game [Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Now well, when I was young, we connected
When we were little bit older, both sprung
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me and rumors are knee deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in a song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days [?], this end game isn't won
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it [Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift &amp; Ed Sheeran]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah, but I ain't tryna play [Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game [Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift &amp; Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Ah, and you heard about me
Oh, I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
Ah, and I heard about you
Ooh, you like the bad ones, too [Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang
We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's a truth from my red lips [Chorus: Taylor Swift, (Future), &amp; (Ed Sheeran)]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string (Me and you)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end gameIf you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
I'll be the light to guide you
Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me like one two three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can count on you like four three two
You'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah
Whoa, whoa
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
If you tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song
Beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Everyday I will
Remind you
Ooh
Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me like one two three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can count on you like four three two
You'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
I'll never let go
Never say goodbye
You know you can
Count on me like one two three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can count on you like four three two
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah
Oh, oh
You can count on me 'cause I can count on youOh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she doesn't see what I see
But every time she asks me, do I look okay
I say When I see your face
There is not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are, hey Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday Oh, you know, you know
You know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay,
You know I'll say When I see your face
There is not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while

our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
when our friends talk about you
all it does is just tear me down
cause my heart breaks a little
when I hear your name It all just sounds like oh,
too young, too dumb to realize
that I should've bought you flowers
and held your hand
should I gave you all my hours
when I had the chance
take you to every party
cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my baby's dancing
but she's dancing with another man My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
caused the good strong woman like you
to walk out my life
now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made
and it hunts me every time I close my eyes It all just sounds like oh,
too young, too dumb to realize
that I should've bought you flowers
and held your hand
should I gave you all my hours
when I had the chance
take you to every party
cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my baby's dancing
but she's dancing with another man Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
I know I'm probably too late
to try and apologize for my mistakes
but I just want you to know I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
when he has the chance
take to every party
cause I remember how much you loved to dance
do all the things I should have done
when i was your man
do all the things I should have done
when i was your manEasy come, easy go, that's just how you live oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Should have known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open,
Why were they open? Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked 'cause
What you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah)

But keep the fives, twenties, tens and bens completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

Eating good, sleeping soundly

Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet

I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I'll swear I'll make it worth it

I should have said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more You were better, deeper
I was under your spell
Like a deadly fear I am, babe
On the highway to Hell I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free

I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more No more, baby, oh Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up every time, oh baby This is the part when I say I don't want it

This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more This is the part when I say I don't want it (This is)

I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right, but that's a lie, that's a lie And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show 'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show 'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows Almost, almost is never enough
We were so close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me, the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms And we almost, we almost knew what love was

Dealing with emotions, that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt, in this game... Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending, what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers, anyway?
When we're the same Break up
Make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind? 'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you 'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh, how do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeves so watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love could be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom so much 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones and we the oddest
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one then I'm the best mistake you ever had Break up
Make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we're blind 'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind boy
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you 'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on You're, you're, you're, you're...
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you You're, you're, you're, you're...
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for youThe sun is setting, in your eye
Here by my side, and the movie is playing,

Til the night I have you, you (ohh)

Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again And to him I just can't be true And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful and it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life I don't wanna be...
A murderer
I feel it in the air As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful and it kills him inside To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head, get it over with I don't wanna do this
Anymore
Whoa, oh oh
Anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer
A murderer (No, no, no)

But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place Yellow diamonds in the light
I was standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless placeEverywhere is still
everything is restless in my heart
i hate the way this feels
suddenly i'm scared to be apart
the days are dark when you're not around
the air is getting hard to breathe
i wish that you would just put me down
i wish that i could go to sleep loving you is suicide
i don't know should go or should i stay
i'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late
but i heard you say you loved me
that's the part i can't forget
and i wish that you come save me
cos i'm standing over the edge i should let you go
tell myself the things i need to hear
but my brain is wired wrong
that's why i'm loving you when you're not here
feels like i drown in your every word
and every breath that's in between
somehow you got me where it really hurts
it's killing every part of me loving you is suicide
i don't know should go or should i stay
i'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late
but i heard you say you loved me
that's the part i can't forget
and i wish that you come save me
boy cos i'm standing over the edge loving you is suicide
and my world's about to break
and i... had as much as i can take
and love is a long way down loving you is suicide
and it's getting harder everyday
i'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late
and i'm way past every moment
but i'm still determined to fight
and i know it's taking all my strength
to keep these emotions alive
loving you is suicideTake a breath, take it deep
Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play the key
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, I'm moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go And you can see my heart, beating
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger) Say a prayer, to yourself
He says, close your eyes sometimes it helps
And then I get, a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost And you can see my heart, beating
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I, ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life And you can see my heart, beating

The summers they ain't the same
These lovers they ain't the game
These feeling, they don't mean nothing
These ceilings can keep the pain
Explanations you say I deserve it
Why after all this time I'm finally worth it
Ain't it funny, a power comes with money
And how now I'm out here poppin'
They come back like they're an option
Man this shit is hella scummy
They claiming that they love me
Cause they realise that my time is finally coming
They know it
Cause my night is your's

While I dug myself a grave
Threw my heart inside
You didn't do a thing [Chorus: Tinashe]
I'm not going down with your love
I gave it my all
But it's never enough
Behind the roses

Right now, love
Only thing keepin' me by your side
Only thing keepin' me by your side nowReal niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning it's more, you see right through walls
Ain't talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come at me
Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy
Y'know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me
Hey, ayy, hey
Attention, all you niggas
All you bitches Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride
You are now watching MADtv Niggas'll lose they mind for it
Wine for it, dine for it (pussy)
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it (pussy)
Double back handicap and go blind for it (pussy)
Pussy got endless prisoners
Pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculating
And good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the gold names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
SolÃ¡na, middle fingers up, speak your truth You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (pussy)
I know what you really 'bout
High key, your dick is weak, buddy
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute
We ain't feelin' you
Think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, SZA)
I'm really tryna crack off that headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
'Cause you that one
Yeah, you that one
Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
That pussy, like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind
I will make you beg for it
I wanna see you call out Sit back and relax your mind, just ride
(Give you all of me and I won't stop, not a little bit)
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why
(Dangerous boy, I wanted to do it all)
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride
(Unfortunately you couldn't get your shit together)
You are now watching MADtv We take things, and my influence so far, and then it's out of my hands.
And, y'know, while as I said it can be scary, it can also be a little bit comforting.
Because I've learned that when I get to that point, and I can acknowledge, Okay, Audrey, that's as much as you can do I can actually let it...[Verse 1]
Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was

Hoping they'll never find out that you're anyone else

But I believe you when you say it like dat

I know you'd rather be laying up with a big booty
Body hella positive 'cause she got a big booty (wow)

Toss them to the side, give them convertibles
Click vroom, I like the way your ride's up
Ken had it all, Skipper wanted more than
Watching from the sidelines, wish that she had it
She wish that she had it
Here in your backyard, building a fantasy
Fuck reality, do you want to know, know me
Do you want to know me?
Stuck in Nintendo, get the controller
Street Fighters and such
I'll finish him
(Down goes Frazier!)
I'll finish him
Come Desdemona
Othello the tragedies
Shakespearean sorrows
When do I begin?
When do we begin? I got L's on my record
Weed on the vinyl
Keys open doors when them keys is albino
Now knock on my door when my stars is a Lionel
I've been fishing for a minute for a minnow
Only I know that a pawn is a trade
And a rookie for a castle like tuition for a final
Playin' hooky for a tassle, spend a minute on the minor
Winds on my window
Ash on my skin, when the record low temps for the wind blow
Only write rhythm to the tardiest of tempos
Only ride shotgun when the car is a limo
Y'ar see
I crowd surf in a cypher
Scuba in my shower, take an Uber to my neighbors
Used to pay the piper, till peter picked it better
Now the first thing you should tell is where the hell is all the paper
But memories keep coming back
All the nights that we used to laugh
Wanna know how I used to was, how I used to was Memories keep playing back, all nights we used to love
Just wondering how we used to was, how we used to was
Memories keep playing back, all nights we used to love
Just wondering how we used to was, how we used to was
Memories keep playing back, all nights we used to love
Just wondering how we used to was, how we used to was
Memories keep playing back, all nights we used to love
Just wondering how we used to was, how we used to was
Memories keep playing back, all nights we used to love
Just wondering how we used to was, how we used to wasShould I assume you didn't mean it like that?
Or should I assume you know exactly how you said it?
You know exactly how you meant it
Should I assume it's me, sweet disposition
Switchin' position, duckin' submission
Or should I assume it's a weekend thing, boy?
You could get ass all week, droppin' that ass
Just think about me, think about me And it sounds good, what's the difference if it sound good?
Split the difference if it's still good
What's the difference if it's still good
Just not yours exclusively?
Used to be all good
Trade it up, now it's all bad
Rang it up, credit all bad
Getting on, never saw that
Mystery number, call back
It better not be her again
Know you wish it wasn't
Know you wish I wasn't Ooh-ooh, so hard to love (so hard)
Darling, you make it too hard to trust
You keep running from me
I'm scared of love
Make it easy for me
I wanna be, it's difficult for me
I'm scared of love, yeah
And you're hard to trust
(You keep) why you running from me?
I'm backing up
Make it easy for me
Don't wanna be scared to love Hopin' you will, hopin' you would
Wish a bitch would, dissin' me
Hopin' you would, kissin' me
Underneath the constellation
If it's any consolation
If it's worth the conversation
I don't do this all of the time
I just say that every time it's worth the lie
It's worth the crime, it's worth the bad karma
I bet you like it rough
Makin' bad decisions how we beggin', and you love it All good, what's the difference?
Still good, split the difference
All good, what's the difference if it's still good
Just not yours exclusively?
Used to be all good
All bad
Tell it, love, that's more than Ooh-ooh, so hard to love (so hard)
Darling, you make it too hard to trust
You keep running from me
I'm scared of love
Make it easy for me
I wanna be, it's difficult for me
I'm scared of love, yeah
And you're hard to trust
(You keep) why you running from me?
I'm backing up
Make it easy for me
Don't wanna be scared to love
You are but a phoenix among feathers
You're broken by the waves among the sea
They'll let you die, they'll let you wash away
But you swim as well as you fly 
Pretty little bird
Pretty little bird
You've hit the window a few times
The window a few times
You're pretty little bird
Pretty little bird
You still ain't scared of no heights
When the spiral down feels as good as the flight
When hating you feels good for the night
When the morning comes I hope you're still mine When the morning comes
If the morning comes
When the morning comes
If the morning comes
When the morning comes
If the morning comes 
Told you I like gentle giants so you softened up
And you been jack'n, bean'n, stalk'n just to get to me love
I wanna be your golden goose
I wanna shave my legs for you
I wanna take all of my hair down and let you lay in it
Spread all of my limbs out and let you lay in it 
Pretty little birds
Pretty little birds
Do you mean every word you mean, every word?
Pretty little girls
Pretty little girls
We hit the window a few times Lately I feel like I'm robbin' myself
Like I'm robbin' mines
Diamond cerebral peek into your cortex
Be faithful and free and just play in your vortex
I see you lying and you fly by the pound
Fly by the ounce
Fly to the south
Don't mind them bitches that's cleanin' my house
Lord, you can see, lord
You can see heights that niggas can't afford
I see them lights and you look for that shit
Fuck all that playin', you pray for that shit
 
But my wings don't spread like they used to
But I wanna fly with you
'Til we hit the heavens
But my wings don't spread like they used to
But I wanna fly with you
'Til we hit the heavens
'Til we hit the heavens 
You say you got a girl
How you want me?
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is wreckless
Of knowin' it's selfish
Knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love
Fallin' all over love, like
Do it to last, last
Hanging out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home?
Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by 10:30
No later than, drop them drawers
Give me what I want My man is my man is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man is your man

You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend
 I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal is two days?

More of them, more of you on me
On us, just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door
Ready to take her place
Ready to give you
What you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for

Drop them drawers, I know what you want My man is my man is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man is your man

Do it to last, last
Hanging out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home?
Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by 10:30
No later than, drop them drawers
Give me what I want My man is my man is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend
 I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal is two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them
More of them, more of you on me
On us, just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door
Ready to take her place
Ready to give you
What you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for
10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want My man is my man is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

Bright ideas
We got bright ideas
Ayyy
Bright ideas
We got bright ideas
Ayyy
Bright ideas
We got bright ideasHow you ain't say you was movin' forward?
Honesty hurts when you're gettin' older
I gotta say I'll miss the way you need me, yeah
Why you ain't say you was gettin' bored?
Why you ain't say I was fallin' short?
How you lead me out so far away? How could it be?
20 something, all alone still
Not a thing in my name
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Only know fear
That's me, Ms. 20 Something
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Wish you were here, oh Stuck in them 20 somethings, stuck in them 20 somethings
Good luck on them 20 somethings, good luck on them 20 somethings
But God bless these 20 somethings
(God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh)
Hopin' my 20 somethings won't end
Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends
Prayin' the 20 somethings don't kill me, don't kill me Weird, took us so long to separate
I feel, it's permanent like a riptide, this time
Waves crashing fast, I try
Think of the past, please stay
How could it be? How could it be?
20 something, all alone still
Not a phone in my name
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Only know fear
That's me, Ms. 20 Something
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Wish you were here, oh Stuck in them 20 somethings, stuck in them 20 somethings
Good luck on them 20 somethings, good luck on them 20 somethings
But God bless these 20 somethings
(God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh)
Hopin' my 20 somethings won't end
Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends
Prayin' the 20 somethings don't kill me, kill me

God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh
God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh
God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh God bless, oh
And if it's an illusion, I don't want to wake up
I'm gonna hang on to it
Because the alternative is an abyss, is just a hole, a darkness, a nothingness
Who wants that? You know?
So that's what I think about CTRL, and that's my story
And I'm sticking to it
That was beautiful mommy, that was perfect
